ProjectEther — Character Stats System (Excel Tool)
Overview

This project is a structured Excel-based stat system designed for balancing and analyzing character progression in ProjectEther. It provides detailed statistical scaling tables, comparisons, and calculated metrics for multiple characters, allowing efficient tuning of gameplay balance and growth curves.

Purpose

The spreadsheet functions as a design and balancing tool used to:

Define character stat progression per level

Compare attributes between characters

Validate scaling formulas

Identify balance gaps between builds

Support combat system tuning

File Structure

The workbook is organized into multiple sheets, each dedicated to a specific function:

Character Sheets

Individual sheets such as:

Verdugo Stats

Juri Stats

Valeria Stats

Each includes level-based progression tables containing:

Base stats per level

Increment gaps between levels

Derived values (such as total HP calculations)

Scaling consistency tracking

Attribute Sheets

Separate sheets for core attributes:

PWR (Power)

VIT (Vitality)

SKL (Skill)

RES (Resistance)

DEX (Dexterity)

HP (Health)

SPD (Speed)

These allow isolated balancing and formula validation for each stat category.

Calculation & Analysis Sheets

Stats Calculator by Character — Aggregates character values dynamically for quick evaluation.

ATK Comparison — Compares offensive output across characters or builds for balance testing.

System Design Features

Level progression modeling

Gap tracking between stat increases

Derived stat formulas (example: HP totals from base + vitality scaling)

Multi-character comparison framework

Modular attribute tuning

Skills Demonstrated

Game systems design logic

Numerical balancing methodology

Spreadsheet system architecture

Formula-based stat modeling

Data organization for design workflows

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Structured formulas

Multi-sheet data referencing

Use Case

This file is intended as a developer-facing balancing tool rather than a player-facing interface. It supports iteration during development to ensure that character progression feels fair, distinct, and scalable across levels.
